  abstract    = {Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) is a well-established imaging technique that provides high-resolution internal structure images of an object at a fast speed. Modern FD-OCT systems typically operate at speeds of 40,000¨C100,000 A-scans/s, but are priced at least tens of thousands of pounds. In this study, we demonstrate a line-field FD-OCT (LF-FD-OCT) system that achieves an OCT imaging speed of 100,000 A-scan/s at a hardware cost of thousands of pounds. We demonstrate the potential of LF-FD-OCT for biomedical and industrial imaging applications such as corneas, 3D printed electronics, and printed circuit boards.

  abstract    = {Reliable and contactless measurements of vital signs, such as respiration and heart rate, are still unmet needs in clinical and home settings. Mm-wave radar and video-based technologies are promising, but currently, the signal processing-based vital sign extraction methods are prone to body motion disruptions or illumination variations in the surrounding environment. Here we propose an image segmentation-based method to extract vital signs from the recorded video and mm-wave radar signals. The proposed method analyses time¨Cfrequency spectrograms obtained from Short-Time Fourier Transform rather than individual time-domain signals. This leads to much-improved robustness and accuracy of the heart rate and respiration rate extraction over existing methods. The experiments were conducted under pre- and post-exercise conditions and were repeated on multiple individuals. The results are evaluated by using four metrics against the gold standard contact-based measurements. Significant improvements were observed in terms of precision, accuracy, and stability. The performance was reflected by achieving an averaged Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 93.8% on multiple subjects. We believe that the proposed estimation method will help address the needs for the increasingly popular remote cardiovascular sensing and diagnosing posed by Covid-19.

  abstract    = {Seed germination and uniform plant stand in the field are the most critical crop growth stages determining the final yield. Pea (Pisum sativum L.) seeds production is often hampered due to the seed dormancy caused by the hard seed coat. Such effect is mainly attributed to poor or uneven germination and unsynchronised seedling emergence. Understanding the time course of water intake and several critical germination indicators can reveal many features of seed germination such as rate and uniformity. This paper used optical coherence tomography (OCT), a noninvasive and cross©\sectional imaging technique, to monitor the inner structural changes throughout the germination process. A sequence of cross©\sectional OCT images of pea (P. sativum L.) seeds, together with additional microscopic optical images, was recorded continuously and in situ for over 40 h. OCT and microscopic images revealed the changes in the internal structure and the external shape of the pea seeds during germination, respectively. It was found that the cross©\sectional OCT images helped to identify the critical indicators distinguishing the different phases of germination pea seeds. Therefore, the presented OCT approach offers a fast and nondestructive way to precisely measure the structural indicators in different germination phases.}
