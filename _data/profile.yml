username: Nate (Xingyu) Yang, P.hD.
description: <br>As a passionate, goal-oriented engineer, I specialise in the development of advanced imaging technologies such as medical devices and industrial quality inspection.<br>With over 7 years of experience in  the reseach field, I developed a strong skillset in optical system design and hands-on free space/fibre optic implementation. As exciting as building the hardware is, it is essential to run thorough optical modelling/simulation piror to implemention, which luckily I'm very much enjoy. I am proficient in runing ray-tracing analysis with ZeMax, 3D mechnical design with CAD software (Creo, Solidworks, FreeCAD), and programming languages including MATLAB, Python, and C/C++.
