          description: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease that can cause vision loss and blindness in people who have diabetes. Treatments are effective but only if the disease is detected early enough. Current methods of detecting DR rely on costly imaging equipment and many skilled personnel to take and interpret retinal images. <br> <br>We have developed novel, low-cost, diagnostic technologies for the detection of DR. These technologies will enable cost-effective, large-scale detection of sight-threatening disease to be performed by non-expert health care workers at the time and place of patient care in China and worldwide.

          description: Here we propose an image segmentation-based method to extract vital signs from the recorded video and mm-wave radar signals. The proposed method analyses time–frequency spectrograms obtained from Short-Time Fourier Transform rather than individual time-domain signals. This leads to much-improved robustness and accuracy of the heart rate and respiration rate extraction over existing methods.
